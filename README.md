## üöÄ Quickstart with Claude Desktop

1. Install `nodejs` to get the `npx` command (node.js module runner). Installation instructions can be found on the [node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

2. Go to Claude > Settings > Developer > Edit Config > claude_desktop_config.json to include the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Bright Data": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@brightdata/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_TOKEN": "<insert-your-api-token-here>",
        "WEB_UNLOCKER_ZONE": "<optional if you want to override the default mcp_unlocker zone name>",
        "BROWSER_AUTH": "<optional if you want to enable remote browser control tools>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üîß Account Setup

1. Make sure you have an account on [brightdata.com](https://brightdata.com) (new users get free credit for testing, and pay as you go options are available)

2. Get your API key from the [user settings page](https://brightdata.com/cp/setting/users)

3. Create a Web Unlocker proxy zone called `mcp_unlocker` in your [control panel](https://brightdata.com/cp/zones)
   - You can override this zone in your MCP server with the env variable `WEB_UNLOCKER_ZONE`

4. (Optional) To enable browser control tools:
   - Visit your Bright Data control panel at [brightdata.com/cp/zones](https://brightdata.com/cp/zones)
   - Create a new 'Browser API' zone
   - Once created, copy the authentication string from the Browser API overview tab
   - The authentication string will be formatted like: `brd-customer-[your-customer-ID]-zone-[your-zone-ID]:[your-password]`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Timeouts when using certain tools

Some tools can involve reading web data, and the amount of time needed to load the page can vary by quite a lot in extreme circumstances.

To ensure that your agent will be able to consume the data, set a high enough timeout in your agent settings.

A value of `180s` should be enough for 99% of requests, but some sites load slower than others, so tune this to your needs.
